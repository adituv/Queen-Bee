# Queen Bee

**Queen Bee** is a browser and editor for the Qb and PAK files used in the Guitar Hero
games (from Guitar Hero 3 onwards) and the Tony Hawk games.

The majority of the application - up to version 1.9 - was written by Nanook; this fork
is AdituV's effort to add greater support for modifying game scripts.
